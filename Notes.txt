What is HTML?
Hyper text markup language
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages, and these elements are represented by tags

-------------------------html heading -------------------------------

opening and closing tag
angle brackets
tag and content inside it is called element

there is no h7 tag


Html heading dos and don'ts 
don't two h1 elements in one page
don't skip between levels, go level wise , h1 then h2 then h3.....


---------------------------Paragraph element-------------------------------
when you wanna display just a plain text. you will see them display on just one line
we can use paragraph , we can see them seperated and a line in between.

to seperate the text in the line of paragraph.

------------------------------Void elements------------------------------
these has angle bracket-content-forward slash- closing angle bracket
there are two void elements break tag and hr tag
<br/>
this breaks the line and whatever comes after it will on next line
 

 <br> and <br/> both are valid but to make it more readable use <br /> to identify the void elements.

dos and don'ts in paragraph tag
use void tags only when necessary 
use paragraph tag to divide the line

----------------------------------List------------------------------
ordered and unordered list

in unordered list order doesn't matter
<ul>
	<li>Milk</li>
	<li>Chease</li>
	<li>Mackaroni</li>
</ul>

ordered list order of list matters, you get numbers in it
<ol>
	<li>Milk</li>
	<li>Chease</li>
	<li>Mackaroni</li>
</ol>


-------------------------------Anchor elements---------------------------------------
it allows us to create a hyperlink


HTML attributes
<tag attribute=value >Content</tag>

you can have as many attributes as you want and we can seperate them
and make sure that they are inside the opening tags

In html we have special attribute 
href --add link
 
global attributes
draggable 

What i learnt in practical 
start attribute to start the numbering from ordered list from 5 or 6 etc

------------------------------Image tag--------------------------------------------

<img src="link"/>
it is a void tag
we can also we a alt tag which describes the image to help blind people
to get random images use picsum photos
we can also use gif tag instead of jpg in src 

it was toggle word wrap in codewithharry
comment out shortcut
